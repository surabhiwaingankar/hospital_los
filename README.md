<b>Overview</b>
<br>
This project aims to predict hospital length of stay using the MIMIC-III dataset, a widely used healthcare database. The length of stay prediction is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and improving patient care.

<b>Features</b>
<br>
1. Dataset: We utilize the MIMIC-III database, which provides comprehensive medical records for thousands of patients.

2. Model: Our predictive model employs [mention the algorithm or model used], leveraging [any specific libraries or frameworks].

3. Performance: We assess the model's performance through metrics such as [e.g., accuracy, precision, recall] and provide insights into its predictive capabilities.

<b>Usage</b>
<br>
1. Data Preprocessing:

Follow the steps in data_preprocessing.ipynb to clean and prepare the MIMIC-III dataset.
2. Model Training:

Execute train_model.ipynb to train the predictive model on the preprocessed data.
3. Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using evaluate_model.ipynb and analyze its performance metrics.
Predictions:

Use make_predictions.ipynb to make predictions on new data and understand the expected length of stay.
